# Structs
* Refactoring functions from script_gen.rs to associated functions for the Play and Player struct, one of the main changes we had to make was evaluting if the original funciton parameters would necessary/function correctly and if not we change the function signuatre, and replace its references in our function with references to the corresponding struct fields.
* Refactoring the process config function invovled splitting up its functionalities for reading part files for lines and adding them to PlayLines to the Player struct under the Prepare associated funciton, and move the portion reading the config file for character and part file names to Play under the process_config associated function. Instead of just reading the line and push it to a Play struct like with the original Process_config in script_gen, the new function delegates the reading lines task to Prepare, and instead create new Player objects containing the read lines and append them to the Play struct's vec<player>
* One challenge was determining when the self reference for associated functions should be mutable. For Recite, we initally made self and immutable reference, resulting in an error because it calls Prepare on its vec of Players, which takes a mutable reference to a Player. Therefore we had to make Recite's self a mutable ref.
* Refactoring Recite was challenging because now each Player object holds all of their lines, so we had to find a way to deliver their lines in order. Our solution was iterating through each Player object's PlayLines vector, get the line number, and create a vector<(usize, usize)> holding the line number and the Player instance's index in the vec<player>. We then sort that vec<(usize, usize)> by the line_num to figure out when each player should speak. We then iterate through the vec<(usize, usize)>, using the returned Player index to call the next_line and speak methods, while also check if the line_num is larger than what the next_line function returns. If it is, we break to prevent the current Player from speaking all of thier lines. 
* We had to change the pathing to alot of the declarations in main.rs and add new declarations to play.rs and player.rs because we removed alot of constants and types from script_gen.rs and declarations.rs.

# Return Wrapper:
* we implemented the wrapper by using a struct and defining 2 functions called report and new. Report has to be implemented for a termination trait because it is in charge of ending ht eprogram and new i had to add because i need it to construct new returnwrappers. at first id dint have it and it gave me lots of compilation errors os io had to add it.

extended your solution to manage multiple consecutive scene fragments, including any design challenges you encountered and how you addressed those.

# Scene Fragments
* To manage multiple consecutive scene fragments, the key change we had to make with in the associated functions add_config and process_config for the Play struct in Play.rs. Specifically, we had to provide implementation of add_config and process_config for the Play struct that correctly reads the Script Config file and correctly create a scenefragment for each config file listed. Then, we had to refactor the read_config, process_config, and prpeare methods in for the SceneFragment struct in scene_fragments.rs so they still correctly works with individual config files. Although the associated function names (prepare/read_config/process_config) are the same between the Play and SceneFragments struct, their functionality is completely different (one is at the Script Config level and the other is at the individal config file level), so separate implementations had to be provided.
* When it comes to reciting all lines in the correct order, our implementation for SceneFragment's recite from Structs section also works here. For the implementation of recite in the Struct section, we create a vector to track the speaker's line number and their index within the vector of Players and, sort it by line number, and iterate through the sorted Player index and call next_line and speak. Since SceneFragment's field structure remained the same as that in the Struct section, our apporach worked with minimal changes.
* Another challenge was implementing the correct functions and return types for the PartialOrd, PartialEq, and Ord traits of Player struct. Rust's documentation was helpful in helping us understand the function name and signature that we needed to implement as well as what the return type looks like.
